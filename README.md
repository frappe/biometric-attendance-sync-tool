## Pre-requisites
* Python 3.6+


## Usage
There's two ways you can use this tool. If accessing the CLI is a bit of a pain for you, the GUI has a simple form to guide you through the process.

Under [/releases](https://github.com/frappe/biometric-attendance-sync-tool/releases), for a particular release download the `biometric-attendance-sync-tool-[version]-[distribution].zip` and unzip it's contents. Now from the location of the unzipped files, you can go ahead with the CLI or GUI method.

### GUI
Run the `attendance-sync` file from the folder; This should setup all it's dependencies automatically and start the GUI.

### CLI
The `erpnext_sync.py` file is the "backbone" of this project. Apart from Windows _(which has its own wrapper `erpnext_sync_win.py`)_, this file can be directly used to set up the sync tool. Further information provided in the [/Wiki](https://github.com/frappe/biometric-attendance-sync-tool/wiki).


## Setup Specifications (For CLI)

1. Setup dependencies
    ```
    cd biometric-attendance-sync-tool
      && python3 -m venv venv
      && source venv/bin/activate
      && pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Setup `local_config.py`

   Make a copy of and rename `local_config.py.template` file. [Learn More](#setting-up-config)

3. Run this script using `python3 erpnext_sync.py`

   To run python script in background add ampersand `&` at the end like this `python3 erpnext_sync.py &`.

   However, unexpected server restarts can kill these background processes too. So to prevent hangup signals, you can even use `nohup` like this `nohup python3 erpnext_sync.py &`

### UNIX

There's a [Wiki](https://github.com/frappe/biometric-attendance-sync-tool/wiki/Running-this-script-in-production) for this.

### Windows

Installing as a Windows service

1. Install pywin32 using `pip install pywin32`
2. Got to this repository's Directory
3. Install the windows service using `python erpnext_sync_win.py install`
4. Done

#### Update the installed windows service
    python erpnext_sync_win.py update

#### Stop the windows service
    net stop ERPNextBiometricPushService

#### To see the status of the service
    mmc Services.msc


## Setting up config
- You need to make a copy of `local_config.py.template` file and rename it to `local_config.py`
- Please fill in the relevant sections in this file as per the comments in it.
- Below are the delineation of the keys contained in `local_config.py`:
  - ERPNext connection configs:
    - `ERPNEXT_API_KEY`: The API Key of the ERPNext User
    - `ERPNEXT_API_SECRET`: The API Secret of the ERPNext User

      > Please refer to [this link](https://frappe.io/docs/user/en/guides/integration/how_to_set_up_token_based_auth#generate-a-token) to learn how to generate API key and secret for a user in ERPNext.
      > The ERPNext User who's API key and secret is used, needs to have at least the following permissions:
      > 1. Create Permissions for 'Employee Checkin' DocType.
      > 2. Write Permissions for 'Shift Type' DocType.

    - `ERPNEXT_URL`: The web address at which you would access your ERPNext. eg:`'https://yourcompany.erpnext.com'`, `'https://erp.yourcompany.com'`
    - `ERPNEXT_VERSION`: The base version of your ERPNext app. eg: 12, 13, 14
  - This script's operational configs:
    - `PULL_FREQUENCY`: The time in minutes after which a pull for punches from the biometric device and push to ERPNext is attempted again.
    - `LOGS_DIRECTORY`: The Directory in which the logs related to this script's whereabouts are stored.
      > Hint: For most cases you can leave the above two keys unchanged.
    - `IMPORT_START_DATE`: The date after which the punches are pushed to ERPNext. Expected Format: `YYYYMMDD`.
      > For some cases you would have a lot of old punches in the biometric device. But, you would want to only import punches after certain date. You could set this key appropriately. Also, you can leave this as `None` if this case does not apply to you.

> TODO: fill this section with more info to help Non-Technical Individuals.

## To build executable file for GUI
### Linux and Windows:
1. Activate virtual environment.
1. Navigate to the repository folder (where `gui.py` located) by
    ```
    cd biometric-attendance-sync-tool
    ```
1. Run the following commands:
    ```
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

    ```
    python -m PyInstaller --name="attendance-sync" --windowed --onefile gui.py
    ```
1. The executable file `attendance-sync` created inside `dist/` folder.
